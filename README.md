# HTML-PORTFOLIO-MINI-PROJECT

# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
# This project is a personal portfolio webpage created using HTML5. A portfolio website is an online representation of a person’s profile, skills, education, experiences, and achievements. It provides a platform to introduce oneself to the world in a professional and structured manner. The webpage designed here demonstrates the use of semantic HTML tags, multimedia integration, forms for interaction, tables for structured data, and lists for categorization.

At the very beginning, the project uses the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which specifies that the document is written in HTML5. The <html lang="en"> tag defines the root element and specifies that the language of the content is English. Inside the <head> section, meta tags such as charset="UTF-8" and viewport are defined to ensure the webpage is responsive and properly displayed across different devices. The <title> tag is used to name the webpage.

The <body> section contains all the visible content of the portfolio. The header section introduces the website with the title “My Portfolio”. By wrapping it inside <header> and <h1>, the content becomes semantically meaningful.

The main section of the page is divided into different semantic tags such as <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <div>. For example, the “Education” and “Experiences” details are included inside <section> tags, which are used for grouping related information. The <article> tag is used to represent a personal story, while the <aside> element is included to represent an advertisement placeholder.

One of the key features is the use of an image with hyperlink. The <a> tag links to an external website (apple.com), and within it, an <img> tag is used to embed an image. Instead of using an image file path, a Base64 encoded image is embedded directly into the source attribute. This demonstrates an alternate way of including images without depending on external files.

Another important aspect of the project is the use of lists (<ul> and <ol>). The unordered list (<ul>) and ordered list (<ol>) are used together to present fruits and their properties such as color and season. This helps demonstrate hierarchical relationships in data representation.

The table element is used to present structured data in tabular form. The <thead> and <tbody> tags separate the header and body of the table, and a <caption> is provided for clarity. This table includes sample student information.

The form element is one of the most interactive parts of the project. It collects user input such as username, password, class selection (radio buttons), favorite subjects (checkboxes), city (dropdown list), and feedback (textarea). This demonstrates how HTML forms can collect different types of user input. Finally, a submit button is included to send the data to the specified action (/action.php).

At the end of the page, an iframe is used to embed a YouTube video. This shows how multimedia content can be integrated directly into the webpage.

The footer section contains contact details, making it easy for visitors to reach out.

Tools Used

HTML5 – The primary language used to build the structure and layout of the webpage.

Web Browser – To run and test the webpage (Google Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

VS Code or any text editor – Used for writing and editing the HTML code.

Base64 encoding tool – Used to convert an image into a Base64 string for embedding directly.

YouTube embed feature – To generate the iframe code for video embedding.

Applicability

This project has several applications:

Portfolio Showcase – Students, job seekers, and professionals can use such a webpage to showcase their skills, education, and experiences in a structured format.

Learning HTML5 – The project covers a wide range of HTML elements, making it an excellent practice exercise for beginners.

Form Handling – Demonstrates how to collect user data via forms, which can later be processed by a backend server.

Embedding Multimedia – Shows how to integrate images, videos, and external links into a webpage.

Website Structure – By using semantic tags, the project ensures better accessibility, SEO optimization, and readability.

Reusable Template – The code can be customized and extended further with CSS and JavaScript to create a more professional, interactive, and visually appealing personal portfolio website.
